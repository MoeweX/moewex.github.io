Distributing IoT data via fog-based pub/sub systems has many advantages, including low latency communication between physically close clients, better availability, and reduced bandwidth consumption in the wide-area network. For building, testing, and evaluating such fog-based pub/sub systems, we identified two main needs: First, the need for considering the unique characteristics of the fog and the IoT. Second, the need for automated execution of fog application experiments in a controllable environment. In this thesis, we present three main contributions to address these needs: Our first contribution is BCGroups, an inter-broker routing strategy for distributing IoT data within fog-based pub/sub systems. BCGroups can be used with existing cloud-based pub/sub offers. For routing messages between brokers fast and efficiently, BCGroups uses IoT-specific domain knowledge: low communication latency is often only required between devices in physical proximity. Our second contribution comprises GeoBroker \u0026 DisGB, two pub/sub broker systems that leverage geo-context for IoT data distribution. In many IoT scenarios, geo-context information is readily available, i.e., publishers often know where their data is relevant, and subscribers can often specify where relevant data originates. When running on a single machine, GeoBroker reduces the load on the broker system, bandwidth consumption, and the number of irrelevant messages that subscribers need to process. DisGB builds upon GeoBroker and also comprises two novel strategies for inter-broker message routing in multi-machine setups. Both strategies achieve a similar communication latency as flooding events or subscriptions while requiring significantly less inter-broker messages. Our third contribution is MockFog, an approach for the automated execution of fog application experiments in the cloud. The main idea is to use an emulated infrastructure testbed that can be manipulated based on a predefined orchestration schedule. This way, fog applications and fog systems can run in the cloud while experiencing comparable performance and failure characteristics as in a real fog deployment. Moreover, it allows application engineers to test arbitrary failure scenarios and various infrastructure options at large scale.","tags":null,"title":"Data Distribution for Fog-Based IoT Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Pfandzelter","Dr. Jonathan Hasenburg","David Bermbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"706d5a34970633f154ee7f5c8764c44c","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/academic/publication/2021-zero2fog/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2021-zero2fog/","section":"publication","summary":"In Internet of Things (IoT) data processing, cloud computing alone does not suffice due to latency constraints, bandwidth limitations, and privacy concerns. By introducing intermediary nodes closer to the edge of the network that offer compute services in proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can reduce network strain and high access latency to application services. While this is the only viable approach to enable efficient IoT applications, the issue of component placement among cloud and intermediary nodes in the fog adds a new dimension to system design. State-of-the-art solutions to this issue rely on simulation or solving a formalized assignment problem through heuristics only, which both have their drawbacks. In this article, we present a five-step process for designing practical fog-based IoT applications that combines best practices, simulation, and testbed analysis to converge towards an efficient system architecture. We then apply this process in a smart factory case study. By deploying filtered options to a physical testbed, we show that each step of our process converges towards more efficient application designs.","tags":null,"title":"From Zero to Fog: Efficient Engineering of Fog‚Äêbased Internet of Things Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Pfandzelter","Dr. Jonathan Hasenburg","David Bermbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619395200,"objectID":"877edb2edf05064c383212adefec1ec2","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/academic/publication/2021-leo/","publishdate":"2021-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2021-leo/","section":"publication","summary":"The new space race is heating up as private companies such as SpaceX and Amazon are building large satellite constellations in low-earth orbit (LEO) to provide global broadband internet access.

This minimizes communication latency and copes well with frequently updated subscriptions and mobile end devices, which is required by many IoT applications.
