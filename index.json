Especially in the IoT, however, the relevance of data often depends on the geo-context, e.g., the location of data source and sink. In this paper, we propose two inter-broker routing strategies that use this characteristic for the selection of rendezvous points. We evaluate analytically and through experiments with a distributed pub/sub prototype which strategy is best suited in three IoT scenarios. Based on simulation, we compare the performance and efficiency of our approach to the state of the art: Our strategies reduce the event delivery latency by up to 22 times compared to the only alternative that sends slightly fewer messages. Our strategies also require significantly less inter-broker messages than all other approaches while achieving at least the same performance.","tags":null,"title":"DisGB: Using Geo-Context Information for Efficient Routing in Geo-Distributed Pub/Sub Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Hasenburg","David Bermbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597104000,"objectID":"8640b3df0c6b8cc81953c082feda0203","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/publication/2020-geobroker4/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-geobroker4/","section":"publication","summary":"The majority of today’s pub/sub brokers only focus on data content when deciding where to distribute data.

Communicating via the cloud, however, results in a latency that is too high for many IoT applications. In this paper, we describe the design of a fog-based pub/sub system that integrates edge resources to improve communication latency between end devices in proximity. To this end, geo-distributed broker instances organize themselves in dynamically sized broadcast groups. Each broadcast group comprises a set of well connected edge brokers that communicate directly using flooding. This minimizes communication latency and copes well with frequently updated subscriptions and mobile end devices, which is required by many IoT applications. Messages between broadcast groups are routed via a massively scalable fog broker that pre-filters messages to reduce excess data dissemination. Our approach, therefore, manages the tradeoff between latency and excess data.","tags":null,"title":"Managing Latency and Excess Data Dissemination in Fog-Based Publish/Subscribe Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Bermbach","Setareh Maghsudi","Jonathan Hasenburg","Tobias Pfandzelter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587427200,"objectID":"c6d638f0f386b31578dcd496a5f723ae","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/publication/2020-auctions/","publishdate":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-auctions/","section":"publication","summary":"The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm has a lot of potential as a computing model for fog environments comprising both cloud and edge nodes.

When the brokers are distributed across the fog, events and subscriptions of clients connected to different broker instances must be routed across the router network. State-of-the art solutions, however, do not take into account that the relevance of the IoT data depends on its origin and purpose. Instead, they assume a uniform data distribution when determining where to match events and subscriptions which degrades system performance. In this paper, we propose a routing solution that builds upon geo-context information attached to published events and subscriptions. This way, we can match events close to either the publishers or subscribers of an event, thus, minimizing communication latency while not affecting scalability.","tags":null,"title":"Using Geo-Context Information for Efﬁcient Rendezvous-based Routing in Publish/Subscribe Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Hasenburg","David Bermbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578268800,"objectID":"3929cc1b5a805ed73b1dbd2a9d5b0998","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/publication/2020-geobroker2/","publishdate":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-geobroker2/","section":"publication","summary":"In the Internet of Things, the relevance of data often depends on the geographic context of data producers and consumers.
