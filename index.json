Today’s data distribution services, however, mostly focus on data content and not on geo-context, which could help to reduce the dissemination of excess data in many IoT scenarios. In this paper, we propose to use the geo-context information associated with devices to control data distribution. We define what geo-context dimensions exist and compare our definition with concepts from related work. Furthermore, we designed GeoBroker, a data distribution service that uses the location of things, as well as geofences for messages and subscriptions, to control data distribution. This way, we enable new IoT application scenarios while also increasing overall system efficiency for scenarios where geo-contexts matter by delivering only relevant messages. We evaluate our approach based on a proof-of-concept prototype and several experiments.","tags":null,"title":"GeoBroker: Leveraging Geo-Contexts for IoT Data Distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Hasenburg","Martin Grambow","David Bermbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575590400,"objectID":"ef27ebf536f7e66ae6ff853673f87136","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/publication/2019-fbase1/","publishdate":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-fbase1/","section":"publication","summary":"The combination of edge and cloud in the fog computing paradigm enables a new breed of data-intensive applications.

Testing fog applications, however, is hard since runtime infrastructures will typically be in use or may not exist, yet. In this paper, we propose an approach that emulates such infrastructures in the cloud. Developers can freely design emulated fog infrastructures, configure their performance characteristics, and inject failures at runtime to evaluate their application in various deployments and failure scenarios. We also present our proof-of-concept implementation MockFog and show that application performance is comparable when running on MockFog or a small fog infrastructure testbed.","tags":null,"title":"MockFog: Emulating Fog Computing Infrastructure in the Cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Grambow","Jonathan Hasenburg","Tobias Pfandzelter","David Bermbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554681600,"objectID":"7c8d3fd8fd65b5d0b3493d196ddf5fe3","permalink":"https://moewex.github.io/publication/2019-docker2/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-docker2/","section":"publication","summary":"Docker seems to be an attractive solution for cloud database bench- marking as it simplifies the setup process through pre-built images that are portable and simple to maintain.
